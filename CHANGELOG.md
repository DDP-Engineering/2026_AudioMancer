# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- JSON-producing AI requests now include OpenAI-compatible
  `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}` when the selected AI profile has
  structured output enabled, with a one-time compatibility retry for providers
  that reject the field.
- Speech Blocks generation now resumes from partially generated, reviewed, or
  approved chunks instead of treating review state as a fresh run.
- AI cleanup, AI-assisted chunking, character discovery, and Speech Blocks now
  size OpenAI-compatible request text windows from 30% of the selected model
  context window, without applying the local LM Studio/Ollama request caps.
- Narrator profile selection now updates the project manifest's narrator
  operation summary immediately, avoiding a repair prompt after restarting the
  app with a valid selected narrator.
- Home workflow progress now trusts explicit operation summaries over the
  linear `current_stage`, so independently completed Narator Voice work no
  longer makes Translation, Characters, or Character Voices appear finished.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- first AudioMancer release with the complete desktop audiobook production
  workflow, offline English and Romanian help, packaging metadata, and release
  documentation aligned to version `1.0.0`
