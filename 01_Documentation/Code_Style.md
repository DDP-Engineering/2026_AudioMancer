# Code Style

## Purpose

This document defines the code style, documentation style, and related
implementation readability rules for `2026_AudioMancer`.

## General Code Style

- Code must be clear, simple, and easily maintainable by a human developer.
- Prefer small, composable modules.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction, wrapper classes, and speculative architecture.
- Keep implementation sufficiently documented so intent, contracts, and
  non-obvious logic remain understandable during maintenance.
- Keep responsibilities separated across parsing, processing, orchestration,
  export, and UI.
- Avoid host-specific assumptions in reusable code.
- Prefer deterministic local configuration and storage paths.
- Preserve public interfaces unless change is explicitly requested.

## Python Documentation Style

For Python source and test files, use a consistent engineering-style header and
Doxygen-like documentation pattern.

Required file prologue:

1. shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
2. encoding line: `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`
3. copyright/license banner using dashed separator lines
4. module docstring with aligned tags. The following are required:
   - `@file`
   - `@brief`
   - `@details`
   Optional only when relevant:
   - `@example`

Docstrings retain applicable `@brief`, `@details`, `@param`, `@return`, and
`@exception` tags, but contain no `@author`, `@date`, or `@version` tags. The
file-top copyright/license comment block is the sole in-file attribution.
Versioning is project-level only, through
`04_Software/AudioMancer/pyproject.toml`,
`04_Software/AudioMancer/src/audiomancer/**init**.py`, and the existing root
`CHANGELOG.md`.

Required section markers where meaningful:

- `IMPORTS`
- `CONSTANTS`
- `DATA MODELS / TYPEDEFINITIONS`
- `HELPER FUNCTIONS` or `LOCAL HELPERS`
- `PUBLIC API` or `EXPORTED FUNCTIONS / PUBLIC API`
- `END OF FILE`

Function, method, class, and nested-helper docstrings should use Doxygen-like
tags whenever the callable or type is non-trivial, part of the public API,
implements important logic, or benefits from an explicit contract.

Required when applicable:

- `@brief`
- `@param[in]`
- `@param[out]`
- `@param[in,out]`
- `@return`

Use when applicable:

- `@exception`
- `@note`
- `@todo`
- `@retval`
- `@example`

Guidance:

- trivial one-line helpers may omit docstrings if the intent is already obvious
- public API functions should normally have docstrings
- classes should have a class-level docstring
- nested wrappers and decorator helpers should be documented when they carry
  non-obvious behavior

Keep these comments concise and engineering-focused. Avoid placeholder prose or
casual commentary.
