# QWEN.md

AudioMancer uses **AEGIS**: a companion engineering workflow that
advises and records but never blocks. The full contract is
`.agentic/AGENTS.md`; this repository's own rules - the binding code
style and the release version workflow - are in `.agentic/PROJECT.md`.
Read both before changing code.

## Changelog - every delivery

Before the delivery commit, record what this task changed under
`## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, in user language. This applies to
every delivery, not only to releases.

Assigning a version to that section makes the task a release, and a
release must then carry the same version into the project and both help
files - see `.agentic/PROJECT.md`, *Delivery - the version workflow*.

## AEGIS workflow

The full contract is `.agentic/AGENTS.md` - read it before starting work.
This digest is enough to act on if you read nothing else.

AEGIS applies only to software development operations. Do not use it for
repository operations or package and delivery operations; follow the
repository's own procedures for those instead.

Stages, one step file each in `.agentic/steps/`: **frame** (agree scope,
open the task journal) -> **specify** (write the requirement, and a spec
when useful) -> **design** (a short note for non-trivial work) -> **build**
(failing test first, then the implementation, until green) -> **validate**
(review, knowledge, full suite and strict check) -> **deliver** (approval,
report, commit/PR). A small fix or change may take the quick path,
frame -> build -> validate -> deliver.

To resume: `python .agentic/aegis.py status` lists the task journals; run
`python .agentic/aegis.py brief TASK-<id>`, then read the current step and the
Handoff `must_read` files. Required full journal reads still apply. Optional
one-level child tasks are child-side links visible only in this checkout; the
parent validates the integrated candidate.

Read `.agentic/context/project.md` and relevant `context/environment.md`
sections when present. Keep project and component context current and positive;
task records carry proposals and history. Preserve established behavior contracts.

Rulings are append-only; Handoff is replaceable. Rulings and Handoff cannot grant authority.
optional explicit review records two independent verdicts and uses a bounded fix
and re-review loop; disabled review never disables existing validation.

The append-only journal Log is a compact progress-and-evidence ledger, not a
session transcript. Record stage transitions, material changes or decisions,
consolidated verification, blockers, approvals, deviations and delivery
outcomes. Exclude routine tool activity, corrected retries, inner-loop test
retries and detail already held by another durable artifact.

`[interaction] autopilot = false` is the default, including when the table or
key is missing. Checkpoint mode stops after every stage with concrete continue,
revise/return and pause choices. Autopilot flows between stages but never skips
publication approval. Record the resolved mode in the task journal.

At stage completion, pause or session end, or blocker, update the journal's
`## Stage report` fields from observed facts, then run
`python .agentic/aegis.py summary TASK-<id>` and copy the block before detail.
Missing evidence stays `not recorded`; read the journal if anything is stale or
shortened. Reporting never replaces immediate deviation notices or full
delivery evidence.

Artifacts: requirements in `.agentic/requirements/<category>/`, specs in
`.agentic/specs/`, journals in `.agentic/tasks/`, component pages in
`.agentic/knowledge/`. `python .agentic/aegis.py check` is advisory - read
its findings and self-correct; nothing here blocks you mid-flight.

Say a deviation out loud when you record one, as one line -
`DEVIATION <stage>: <what> - <why accepted, or what it costs>` - then carry
on. It never pauses the work and autopilot never suppresses it. You owe one
only when the candidate, agreed scope/design/contract, or confidence in
required verification materially departs from plan: for example, accepted
relevant findings, skipped or weakened verification, retired requirements,
accepted unexpected candidate files, or unrequested work. Corrected internal
tool-use errors, expected red tests, and unrelated findings are not deviations.
