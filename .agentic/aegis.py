@file aegis.py
@brief The AEGIS companion CLI: a scaffolder and a reporter.
@details Single file, stdlib only, Python >= 3.11. Invoked as
         `python .agentic/aegis.py <cmd>` from the repo root on Windows and
         Linux alike; it locates its own `.agentic` directory from
         `__file__`, never from the working directory. Commands exit 0 on
         success and 1 with a one-line message on user error - no
         tracebacks for expected failures.
@details The ownership split is law here: `requirements/`,
         `specs/`, `tasks/` and `knowledge/` are user data and are only
         ever created as empty folders; `aegis.toml` is written only when
         absent; root pointer files are appended to under a marker.

POINTER_DIGEST = """\
## AEGIS workflow

The full contract is `.agentic/AGENTS.md` - read it before starting work.
This digest is enough to act on if you read nothing else.

Stages, one step file each in `.agentic/steps/`: **frame** (agree scope,
open the task journal) -> **specify** (write the requirement, and a spec
when useful) -> **design** (a short note for non-trivial work) -> **build**
(failing test first, then the implementation, until green) -> **validate**
(review, knowledge, full suite and strict check) -> **deliver** (approval,
report, commit/PR). A small fix or change may take the quick path,
frame -> build -> validate -> deliver.

To resume: `python .agentic/aegis.py status` lists the task journals; open
`.agentic/tasks/TASK-<id>.md`, read its `stage:` line and `## Log`, open
that stage's step file, and continue at the first unticked item of
`## Done checklist`.

Artifacts: requirements in `.agentic/requirements/<category>/`, specs in
`.agentic/specs/`, journals in `.agentic/tasks/`, component pages in
`.agentic/knowledge/`. `python .agentic/aegis.py check` is advisory - read
its findings and self-correct; nothing here blocks you mid-flight.

Say a deviation out loud when you record one, as one line -
`DEVIATION <stage>: <what> - <why accepted, or what it costs>` - then carry
on. It never pauses the work and autopilot never suppresses it. You owe one
for an accepted `check` warning, a non-zero exit or a verification you
skipped, an unexpected `anchor`/`evolution` report, a manual method standing
in for an automatable test, a retired requirement, and unrequested work found
in review.
