# AEGIS Light — agent workflow

## This repository

**Read `.agentic/PROJECT.md` before you start.** It carries the rules
that are specific to AudioMancer and are not optional: the binding code
style (`01_Documentation/Code_Style.md`), where the source and tests
live, and the four-place version workflow that delivery must follow.

## Philosophy

This workflow is guidance, not enforcement. Nothing blocks you mid-flight:
the lifecycle lives in these instructions, git is the state store and the
undo, and `python .agentic/aegis.py check` is an advisory report you read
and self-correct against — it always exits 0 outside CI. Work is durable
because every artifact is a plain file committed on the branch: one
requirement per file, one journal per task, one page per component. You
can skip a step; the journal is what a reviewer reads to see that you
did. Do the steps honestly and keep the journal true.

## Stages

| # | Stage | Step file | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | frame | `.agentic/steps/1_frame.md` | Understand the ask, agree scope, open the task journal. |
| 2 | specify | `.agentic/steps/2_specify.md` | Write or update the requirement(s), and a spec when useful. |
| 3 | design | `.agentic/steps/3_design.md` | A short design note for non-trivial work; cite requirement IDs. |
| 4 | build | `.agentic/steps/4_build.md` | Failing test first, then implementation, until green. |
| 5 | deliver | `.agentic/steps/5_deliver.md` | Full suite, strict check, knowledge pages, report, commit/PR. |

**Quick path.** For a small fix or change: `frame → build → deliver`.
Decide this in `frame`, record `path: quick` in the journal header, and
say why in the log. Everything else uses the full path.

**Adopting an existing repo** into this workflow is not a stage — follow
`.agentic/steps/adopt.md` once, then work normally. Adoption journals use
their own stage values (`survey → components → close → done`), all
defined in that one file; `status` points them back at it.

## Where everything lives

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Requirements | `.agentic/requirements/<category>/REQ-<CAT>-<hex>.toml`, one file each |
| Category folders | `functional/ ux/ nfr/ security/ data/ platform/ reliability/ test/` for `REQ-FUNC/UX/NFR/SEC/DATA/PLAT/REL/TEST` |
| Specs (optional) | `.agentic/specs/REQ-<CAT>-<hex>.md` |
| Task journals | `.agentic/tasks/TASK-<hex>.md`, one per task, kept after delivery |
| Component knowledge | `.agentic/knowledge/<component>.md`, one page per component |
| Templates | `.agentic/templates/` — `requirement.toml`, `spec.md`, `task.md`, `component.md` |
| Step files | `.agentic/steps/` |
| Config | `.agentic/aegis.toml` — test/lint commands, source and test globs |

Source code and tests stay where the repo already keeps them. Never write
work products anywhere else; `check` flags strays.

**Do not edit the payload.** `AGENTS.md`, `steps/`, `templates/`,
`aegis.py` and `LICENSE.txt` are replaced wholesale when this workflow is
upgraded, so any change you make there is silently lost. Found a bug in
`aegis.py`, or need a rule the steps do not cover? Say so and let the
human decide — a project-specific rule belongs in a file this repository
owns, not in the payload. Everything else under `.agentic/` —
`requirements/`, `specs/`, `tasks/`, `knowledge/`, `aegis.toml` — is
yours to write.

## Resume a task

1. Open the task journal named in the prompt,
   `.agentic/tasks/TASK-<id>.md` (or run `python .agentic/aegis.py status`
   to list open tasks and their stages).
2. Compare `git branch --show-current` with the journal's `branch:` line.
   On a mismatch, stop and reconcile first — check out the recorded
   branch, or say so if it does not exist here — before touching anything.
3. Read its `stage:` line and its `## Log`; open the step file for that
   stage from the table above.
4. Continue at the first unticked item of `## Done checklist`. The
   checklist always belongs to the **current** stage: advancing a stage
   replaces it with the next stage's "Done when" list (each step file's
   last step says so).

The journal is a committed file, so this works across sessions, machines,
and models. End every session by updating the journal. A journal travels
only with its branch: to continue on another computer, commit and push
the branch first (ask before pushing), then pull there — uncommitted work
never crosses machines.

## Interaction modes

- **Checkpoint (default).** Stop and ask twice, not once per stage: at
  the end of `frame` (scope, chosen path, proposed requirements — the
  cheap moment to course-correct) and before the `deliver` commit/PR
  (report plus check and suite results, presented for a yes). The stages
  in between flow through without asking.
- **Autopilot.** When the prompt says "autopilot to deliver", suppress
  the frame stop. The pre-PR stop always remains, because publishing is
  the outward-facing act.

These pauses are conversational and sit on top of whatever permission or
sandbox prompts your host already applies. Autopilot loses no
auditability: the journal still shows the scope decision, the red-test
line, the check findings, and the ticked checklists after the fact.

## Prompt cheatsheet

Starting work is one line:

```
using aegis workflow, implement feature X
```

That means: read this file, start at `1_frame.md`, and continue through
the stages, stopping where the interaction mode says to. Add `autopilot
to deliver` to suppress the frame stop. `fix X` or `change X` work the
same way — `frame` decides whether they take the quick path.

For a small local model, give one stage per session:

| Stage | One-line prompt |
|---|---|
| frame | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Start task "<title>": follow .agentic/steps/1_frame.md and write the task journal.` |
| specify | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Continue TASK-<id> (stage specify): follow .agentic/steps/2_specify.md, then update the task journal.` |
| design | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Continue TASK-<id> (stage design): follow .agentic/steps/3_design.md, then update the task journal.` |
| build | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Continue TASK-<id> (stage build): follow .agentic/steps/4_build.md, then update the task journal.` |
| deliver | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Continue TASK-<id> (stage deliver): follow .agentic/steps/5_deliver.md, then update the task journal.` |
| adopt | `Read .agentic/AGENTS.md. Adopt this repo: follow .agentic/steps/adopt.md, one component per session.` |

## Commands you will use

```
# "python" throughout - use "python3" on Linux distributions without it
python .agentic/aegis.py status                 # open tasks, or one task's state
python .agentic/aegis.py task new "<title>"     # new task journal
python .agentic/aegis.py req new <cat> "<t>"    # new requirement file
python .agentic/aegis.py check                  # advisory report, always exits 0
python .agentic/aegis.py test --impacted        # fast inner loop during build
python .agentic/aegis.py test                   # full suite, used at deliver
python .agentic/aegis.py report TASK-<id>       # delivery summary into the journal
```
