<!-- AEGIS:TEMPLATE
Task journal: one per task at .agentic/tasks/TASK-<id>.md, kept as the task's
record after it closes. `python .agentic/aegis.py task "<title>"` creates it.
For an existing task, pass its bare TASK-<id> to the commands below and use its
path with file tools; never open a second journal for the same task.

Who writes what:
- The CLI writes the header stage, the Done checklist, Log lines, Rulings and
  State. `advance` moves to the next stage on the path (or `--to` a named one),
  `pause` records a stop or a blocker, `log` adds one durable event, `ruling`
  adds one decision and `verdict` records explicit review results. Each prints
  the summary and the next step.
- You edit Frame, Requirement coverage and Design directly, tick Done checklist
  items as they are met, and edit the header lines type, path, interaction,
  requirements and parent in place: one `key: value` per line, no blank lines
  or comments inside the header block.

Header values:
  stage         frame | specify | design | build | validate | done
                (adoption: survey | components | close | done; deliver is a
                legacy stage that closes to done)
  type          feature | fix | change | adopt
  path          full | quick
  interaction   checkpoint | autopilot
  requirements  comma-separated requirement IDs; empty until specify, except a
                quick fix of an existing contract, which records its IDs at frame
  parent        optional top-level TASK-<id>; blank for an ordinary task
  branch, base, opened   written at creation; leave them unchanged

Log only durable events: decisions, verification results, discoveries,
blockers, approvals and deviations - not routine reads, edits or retries.

State fields, written by the CLI and read by `brief` and `summary`:
  status        working | waiting | blocked | ready | done
  reported      <stage> - in_progress | completed | paused | blocked | skipped
  next          one action or one question
  must_read     the journal, the stage's step file and any --read paths
  changed, evidence, issues    one line each, from --changed, --evidence, --issues
  spec_compliance, implementation_quality    approved | changes_required | disabled
  review_round  1 through 1 + max_fix_cycles; blank while review is disabled

# TASK-0000 — <one-line title>

stage: frame
type: feature
path: full
interaction: checkpoint
requirements:
parent:
branch: <branch>
base:
opened: 2026-01-01

Edit Frame, Requirement coverage and Design directly. Write State, Log and
Rulings with `python .agentic/aegis.py` (advance, pause, log, ruling, verdict);
end each session with `advance` or `pause`.

## Requirement coverage

<!-- AEGIS:TEMPLATE
One row per atomic behavior: one trigger or state, one observable response.
Each atomic behavior maps to exactly one requirement. Specify fills the
first four columns; design fills the last.
| Frame outcome | Atomic behavior | Requirement | Verification | Design decision or no impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
-->

## Design

<!-- AEGIS:TEMPLATE
Filled at design when the task is non-trivial; otherwise record why skipped.
-->

## Log

- 2026-01-01 frame: journal opened

## Rulings

<!-- AEGIS:TEMPLATE
`aegis.py ruling` appends one line per decision; earlier lines are never
edited. A changed decision is a new ruling with --supersedes RULING-<old-id>.
- RULING-001 | date=YYYY-MM-DD | decision=<decision> | reason=<reason> | source=user | supersedes=none
